# CS50 Submissions
### Usage
This repository, or any of its files, are not, under any circumstances, to be submitted by other students as their own work. Their usage should not in any shape or form violate the academic integrity of CS50 or Harvard. Any usage aginst these terms will be reported to proper academic authorities as soon as time permits. They are for portfolio and educational use exclusively.

### Process
These files took a lot of time to make and were all written by me, excluding parts provided during couse of instruction -- such as helper functions or boilerplate foundations. I spent a lot of time on this code and want to be able to show it off. All of these files were written with comments and spacing: these were not added later.

Please send me an email or message with questions,
